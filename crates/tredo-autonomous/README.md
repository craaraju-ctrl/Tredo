# tredo-autonomous

The intelligence layer of the tredo trading system — agent hierarchy, debate, skills, and temporal pipeline.

## What it provides

- **Agent Hierarchy** — Two-tier architecture with main agents (LLM-capable) and deterministic sub-agents across 4 groups (Identifier, Verifier, Executer, Guardian)
- **5-Layer Adversarial Pipeline** — `HardRulesGate` (Layer 1) → `RegimeClassifier` (Layer 2) → `DebateLayer` (Layer 3: BullTeam/BearTeam/Synthesizer) → `Judge` (Layer 4) → `Execution` (Layer 5). No LLM dependency — all intelligence is evidence-based and regime-adaptive.
- **HardRulesGate** (`hard_rules_gate.rs`) — Layer 1: Priority-based hard rule enforcement (Critical > High > Medium > Low). Critical/High always block. Medium blocks only if no Higher override. Low = warnings only. Single top-level gate before any advisory layers.
- **Debate Layer** (`debate_layer.rs`) — Layer 3: Multi-round adversarial debate system with BullTeam (12 bullish factors), BearTeam (11 bearish factors), Synthesizer, and Judge. The Judge evaluates debate quality ONLY — does NOT re-run risk/regime/confluence checks (those are handled by HardRulesGate).
- **Autonomous Orchestrator** — `AutonomousOrchestrator` that wraps the full agent pipeline with state management and COT tracking
- **Skills Implementation** — Concrete `AgentSkill` implementations: SentimentAnalyzer, VolatilityCalculator, RegimeDetector, CorrelationChecker, OnChainData, NewsAnalyser, MarketMetricsMeter
- **Market Intelligence** — Market scanning, pivot/confluence analysis, pattern detection, Kronos forecast, news analysis, market metrics (Bollinger, ATR, Stochastics, RSI, volume profile)
- **Per-Sub-Agent COT** — All sub-agents push COT entries during pipeline runs with action, confidence, and reasoning
- **Reflection & Meta-Control** — Post-trade regret scoring, lesson extraction, automatic rule adaptation
- **Outcome Processor** — `OutcomeProcessor` that handles trade outcomes, regret scoring, and automatic deep reflection triggering
- **Episodic Memory** — SQLite-backed trade journal with regret tracking and rule change history
- **Self-Evolution** — Closed loop: debate → paper execution → reflection → meta rule adaptation
- **Regime Classification** — `RegimeClassifier` for market regime detection (trending, ranging, volatile, etc.)
- **Risk Guardian** — `RiskGuardian` for advanced portfolio-level risk monitoring
- **Walk-Forward Runner** — `WalkForwardRunner` for out-of-sample validation of strategies
- **Orchestrator Pipeline** — 6-phase pipeline for full cycle execution with chain_id tracking
- **State Management** — Shared state with OHLCV history, portfolio, rules, COT tree, skill votes, aggregated signal

## Usage

```rust
use tredo_autonomous::debate::DebateCoordinator;
use tredo_autonomous::state::SharedState;
use tredo_autonomous::orchestrator_struct::AutonomousOrchestrator;

// Get the agent hierarchy tree JSON (for TUI display)
let tree = AutonomousOrchestrator::tree_json();
```

Depends on `tredo-core`.
